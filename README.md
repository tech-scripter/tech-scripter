### 📌 About Me
I'm a Backend Developer with 3+ years of commercial experience, working in agile teams (5-13 people) using Scrum and Kanban.  
Strong communicator with mentoring experience — helped QA engineers improve their Git skills.  

I’ve proposed and led technical improvements, including logging library migrations and cost-saving custom dashboards.  
Passionate about AI, programming language internals, and continuous learning.  

Outside of work, I enjoy writing tech posts and conducting mock interviews for junior and mid-level developers.
